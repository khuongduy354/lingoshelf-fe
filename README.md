# Why
- I find native ebook reader inconvinient when I switch devices, and they also store very limited books format.
- I don't find a web based Ebook Reader, I usually use Google Drive to store all of my books and docs, but Google Drive
doesn't support ebooks reader features: translation, bookmarking,...
- So, I decided to make this web app, and primarily use it for language learning through books.
